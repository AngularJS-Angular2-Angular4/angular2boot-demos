# Angular 2 Boot demos

This is a repository with several demo projects using Angular 2 Boot, meaning those are web applications running in theh browser, programmed in Java 8 with the Angular 2 runtime.

Here is a list of the projects together with a little description :

- `my-first-tree-orchard` : a little game, developped for the talk on **Angular2Boot** given at JavaOne 2016.
- `angular2gwt-memos` : a kind of todo list application, integration between MaterializeCSS and Angular2Boot, presented at **GWTCon 2016** conference.
- `angular2gwt-demo-canvas` : playing with the **canvas element** through Angular 2 and Java 8.
- `misc-samples` : demo of some capabilities of Angular 2, mainly about **how components can discuss with each other**.
- `widgets-integration` : integration of **GWT legacy Widgets in an Angular2Boot application**. This can help you finding a migration path from a legacy application to a modern one.
- `widgets-integration-wayback` : integration of **Angular 2 components in a legacy GWT application**. This can help you finding a migration path from a legacy application to a modern one.
- `angular2gwt-materialize` : using Angular2Boot together with **MaterializeCSS**, not ready yet!
